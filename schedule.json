    "title": "Embench\u2122 0.5: A Free Benchmark Suite for  IoT from an Academic-Industry Cooperative",
    "category": "sat",
    "abstract": "          <p>\n            In June we announced <a href=\"https://embench.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Embench</a>\u2122 (for\n            Embedded Benchmark), a benchmark for embedded IoT devices created by experts from both\n            academia and industry. We first looked at past benchmark efforts to try to incorporate\n            their good ideas and to avoid their mistakes, and drew the following seven lessons:\n            <ol>\n              <li>Embench must be free (no cost).</li>\n              <li>Embench must be easy to port and run.</li>\n              <li>Embench must be a suite of real programs.  </li>\n              <li>Embench must have a supporting organization that maintains its relevance over time.  </li>\n              <li>Embench must report a single summarizing performance score.  </li>\n              <li>Embench should report geometric mean and standard deviation as the summarizing score. </li>\n              <li>Embench must involve both academia and industry.</li>\n            </ol>\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Our plan is to follow \u201cAgile Benchmark Development\u201d by bringing out an initial 0.5\n            version for evaluation and feedback,  with a 1.0 version to be released after a few\n            iterations of preliminary Embench versions (0.5, 0.6, 0.7,...) to debug both the suite\n            and the ground rules. We initially aim to evaluate microcontrollers that support \u226464KiB\n            of code and read only data\u2014which would typically be stored in Flash or ROM\u2014and \u226416KiB of\n            data.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In this talk we describe Embench 0.5. Unlike the popular Dhrystone and CoreMark\n            benchmarks that are single synthetic programs, Embench 0.5 suite has 20 real\n            programs. They do little or no floating point computation, but some are branch\n            intensive, some memory intensive, and some integer compute intensive. Like SPEC, the\n            single performance number that people will promote is the geometric mean of performance\n            relative to a reference platform of the 20 programs plus the geometric standard\n            deviation to indicate the significance of differences between processors. Novel features\n            of Embench include reporting code size as well as program performance and to measure\n            interrupt latency and context switching. These novel features play an important role in\n            embedded computing but have not yet appeared in embedded benchmarks. The Free and Open\n            Source Silicon (FOSSi) Foundation organization is the official sponsor of Embench. The\n            Embench organizing committee now has more than 10 volunteers to evolve the benchmark.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            In addition to announcing Embench 0.5, we will demonstrate its value by contrasting its\n            performance evaluation of several embedded systems to Dhrystone and CoreMark.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Our hope is that henceforth is that publications of performance for embedded computers\n            will include Embench along with Dhrystone and CoreMark, and that Embench will eventually\n            retire these much older, single, synthetic benchmarks to the dustbin of history.\n          </p>\n          <h6>Presenter: <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/jeremypbennett\" target=\"_blank\">Jeremy Bennett</a></h6>\n          <p>\n            Jeremy Bennett is Vice-chair and convener of the Embench working group, which is\n            developing a new set of benchmarks for Embedded systems.\n          </p>\n"

The existence of an open-source\n  test suite will benefit the tool development community by\n  establishing an objectively measurable common goal.

    "abstract": "The rise of open hardware pushed by open architectures such as RISC-V must be accompanied by open tool suites making it accessible to the largest number. Today, two distinct profiles are required to produce an electronic device: hardware designers and software developers. Hardware designers often work on close-source, expensive tool suites with only a small degree of freedom, to produce a suitable hardware prototype. Once low-level software produced (kernel, drivers...) from the hardware specification, software developers then use the prototype as a support for their developments and testing, with other tools. This long, sequential process could be dramatically shortened by using a unique collaborative tool, centered around a software representation of the hardware: a virtual platform.\n\nIn this talk, we will present Hiventive's multi-simulator virtual platform engine running a RISC-V virtual platform embedding a Linux distribution. Compare to existing solutions, Hiventive's multi-simulator doesn't focus on only one simulator, but instead take advantage of existing great simulators like QEMU, GEM5, and more.\n\nPresenter: Benjamin Barrois\nBenjamin Barrois is the CTO and one of the co-founders of Hiventive, a young startup aiming to revolutionize the way electronics products are designed.
