          <p>
	    System Hyper Pipelining (SHP) is a design transformation process. It converts for instance single CPUs into
	    multithreaded CPU. Individual threads can be stalled, bypassed and reordered and can therefore be executed at
	    different speeds. SHP is ideal for FPGAs. An open source project based on an RV32IMAC, the ARTY board and the
	    Arduino IDE is presented during the conference.

	    Kunal will talk about a novel technique of building open-source hardware community using adaptive and
	    adaptable learning mode with open-source EDA tools. The gap confronted here is shortfall of guidelines and
	    support systems to use these tools, and one architecture that connects complete design to all tools. VSD has
	    been attempting to fill this gap by blending the learning and practicing methods through online video courses with
	    the goal of building a large community across the globe who are designing and innovating using open-source tools.

	    One year ago at ORConf 2016 we <a href="2016/#jenkins">announced</a> the work on
	    <a href="https://www.librecores.org/static/librecores-ci" target="_blank">LibreCores CI</a>
	    - a continuous integration service for projects being hosted on
	    <a href="https://librecores.org" target="_blank">LibreCores</a>. During the last
	    year we made some progress on this front, and we would like to talk about the
	    current project status.
	    </p>
	  <p>
	    We will show show the project has evolved and present several examples and success
	    stories. Then we will have an open discussion about the system requirements and
	    beta testing.

	    <a name="autofpga" class="anchor" href="#autofpga"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span>
            </a>AutoFPGA: An FPGA Component Aggregator</h4>
          <p>
	    Placing a CPU into a new environment can be a daunting task.  Components need to be selected, resources allocated, 
	    addresses given, interrupts assigned, and peripherals configured--not only in RTL but also for all of the
	    software support. The problem with this approach to designing hardware is that it works very well for
	    one-off solutions, but not for quickly creating generic solutions to new problems.  This is where 
	    <a href="https://github.com/ZipCPU/autofpga" target="_blank">AutoFPGA</a> comes in.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Given a set of components, it builds the boiler plate files, the top level and main design files, the
	    Wishbone interconnect, and the software header files necessary for software support within that design.
	    As a result, I can reconfigure a project with new hardware in a matter of minutes, rather than the days it
	    took before.

            </a>Open SoC Debug: Reusable debug and trace components with added value</h4>
          <p>
	    While some claim to write bug-free software (once it compiles), most of us (voluntarily or not) rely
	    on debugging tools during software development. On a regular desktop PC, the job is usually done by
	    firing up a GDB instance. However, things get a bit more complicated when software runs on an embedded
	    system. A number of challenges arises: remote debugging must be supported, non-intrusive debugging
	    techniques are needed, and all of that with minimal cost to the final chip.
	  </p>
	  <p>The <a href="http://opensocdebug.org/" target="_blank">Open SoC Debug (OSD)</a> project aims to provide infrastructure to enable SoCs to be debuggable.
	    First of all, OSD is a specification of a debug and trace system. The specification describes an
	    architecture and infrastructure components which are essential in a debug and trace system.
	    In addition, OSD comes with a reference implementation of both hardware components to be added
	    to a SoC, and a software implementation which runs on a host PC and connects the user to the
	    chip when debugging.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    In this talk, I'll give an overview of Open SoC Debug, revisit what happened in the project since
	    the last ORConf, and given an outlook on what's up next.

            </a>Bringing up cycle-accurate models of RISC-V cores</h4>
          <p>
	    The openness of the RISC-V ISA has enabled the development of many open-source RISC-V cores with
	    varying capabilities. Choosing an implementation that meets given requirements can be done to some
	    extent by comparing specifications and other attributes of the cores, but any decision must be based
	    on actual testing. Using Verilator to generate cycle-accurate models enables rapid development of testing
	    platforms.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This talk provides a report of our experience bringing up cycle-accurate models of two cores in particular,
	    <a href="https://github.com/pulp-platform/riscv" target="_blank">RI5CY</a> from the
	    <a href="http://www.pulp-platform.org/" target="_blank">PuLP project</a>, and
	    Clifford Wolf's <a href="https://github.com/cliffordwolf/picorv32?hn=1" target="_blank">PicoRV32</a>.
	    For testing, a software ecosystem consisting
	    of a compiler, binary utilities, debugger, and an interface between the model and debugger accompanies
	    the Verilator model.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    To compare the cores, we used the GCC test suite and the RISC-V ISA test suite for measuring correctness,
	    and the Bristol/Embecosm Embedded Benchmark Suite (BEEBS) to compare performance. All code and scripts
	    used for the implementation are open-source, and can be re-used by others who wish to do similar exercises
	    with other RISC-V cores.

            </a>UVVM – Universal VHDL Verification Methodology – The standardised VHDL testbench architecture</h4>
          <p>
	    For an FPGA design we all know that the architecture – all the way from the top to the micro architecture – is
	    critical for both the FPGA quality and the development time. It should really be obvious that this also applies to the testbench.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    Most FPGA designs are split into stand-alone modules – for instance for each of the FPGA external interfaces.
	    In VHDL these modules are VHDL entities (components), and they are normally accessed from a CPU via a more
	    or less standardised register interface, which acts as an abstraction layer. This abstraction allows a safe
	    and very efficient control of the complete FPGA.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    It becomes clear that this approach should also be used for the verification environment - to simplify the
	    testbench architecture and the control of the interfaces. This way the verification structure will mirror the
	    design structure, allowing the best possible overview, readability, maintainability and reuse.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    <a href="http://www.bitvis.no/products/uvvm/" target="_blank">UVVM</a> provides a very simple and powerful architecture for this – to allow designers to build their own
	    test harness much faster than ever before – using a mix of their own and open source verification components.
	    OSVVM may be used seamlessly with UVVM, so that Constrained Random and Functional Coverage may be combined
	    with a great architecture and infrastructure, and controlled in an easily understandable, maintainable and
	    reusable way.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	    This presentation will show you how simple this is to understand, build and control.

          <p>
            SMP systems with out-of-order processors provide sequentially
            consistent memory operations by performing speculation and delayed
            commit. On the other hand, implementing sequential consistency
            increases hardware complexity on in-order SMP systems, where even a
            small amount of area gain matters significantly. Thus, a
            low-complexity method for sequential consistency model on low-power
            in-order SMP systems is appealing.

            </a>End-to-end formal ISA verification of RISC-V processors with riscv-formal</h4>
          <p>
            Formal hardware verification (hardware model checking) can prove
            that a design has a specified property. This is different from
            simulation, which can only demonstrate that a property holds for
            some concrete traces (sets of inputs). Historically only very
            simple properties have been provable this way, but improvements in
            model checkers over the last decade enable us to prove very
            complex design properties nowadays.
          </p>
          <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/cliffordwolf/riscv-formal" target="_blank">riscv-formal</a>
	    is a framework for formally verifying <a href="https://riscv.org/" target="_blank">RISC-V</a>
            processors directly against a formal ISA specification. (The ISA
            specification used in riscv-formal is itself formally verified
            against <a href="https://github.com/riscv/riscv-isa-sim" target="_blank">Spike</a>
	    , the official RISC-V simulator and ""golden reference""
            implementation.) riscv-formal can be made to work with any existing
            processor design, all that is needed is to add an additional RVFI
            (RISC-V formal interface) trace port to the core.
          </p>
          <p>
            riscv-formal by default uses the open source <a href="http://symbiyosys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
							    target="_blank">SymbiYosys</a>
            toolchain to perform the formal proofs, but it should be compatible
            with all major HDL formal verification flows.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this presentation I will discuss how the complex task of
            verifying a processor against the ISA specification is broken down
            into smaller verification problems in riscv-formal, how to implement
            RVFI, how integrate a core with riscv-formal, and what kind of bugs
            can be detected using our method.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of the proofs performed by riscv-formal are bounded proofs,
            i.e. it is only proven that the properties hold for the first N
            cycles after reset. But with a sufficiently large N we can create
            high confidence that in fact all relevant states can be reached
            within the bound of the proof and that therefore the bounded case
            is a sufficient proxy for the more general unbounded case.
            Abstractions, cut-points, and blackboxing can further help extend
            the effective bound of the proof. The presentation also touches on
            those techniques.
