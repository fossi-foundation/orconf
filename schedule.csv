            Interfaces, Processors and Systems) Alliance harnesses the energy of open source
            collaboration to accelerate hardware development. The organization was created to host
            and curate high-quality, open source hardware design relevant to the design of silicon
            devices. By creating a neutral and collaborative environment, CHIPS Alliance intends to
            share resources to lower the cost of development and accelerate the creation of more
            efficient and innovative chip designs – covering the span from small IoT devices to
            large datacenter silicon solutions.

             The growth of human and business interaction with
             technology continues to explode. At the literal heart of
             that technology sits a silicon core, combined with
             general and specific instructions and connections. The
             insane cost, risk, development time, necessary volumes,
             and limited computing demands kept the lucrative chip
             opportunity within reach of just a handful of companies
             -- focused mostly on general purpose processors. New
             computing needs in various power and performance
             dimensions have increased demand and competition for
             custom processors. This pressure is quietly and rapidly
             disrupting the processor industry. An Open source
             approach to processors now reduces risk and investment,
             with accelerated time to market, and opens the
             opportunity to thousands of possible custom
             processors. Learn about the trends, opportunities, and

                Open source penetrates the microelectronics design, making hardware development more accessible.
                To leverage this effect, one needs open CAD tools, including formal verification facilities.
                The talk is concentrated on an experimental comparison of several open-source model checkers
                for Verilog modules on open benchmarks. For selected tools Verilog support and property checking
                facilities were evaluated on typical designs and industrial-scale modules. This talk also

            When debugging C applications, whilst the debugger handles high level operations, it
            abstracts and offloads lower level operations to a debug server which is responsible for
            controlling the process or hardware. The debug server is capable of very simple
            operations, such as reading/writing registers and memory, starting and single-stepping
            the processor and reporting back when the processor halts. The two communicate with each
            other using a very simple text based serial protocol.
          </p>
          <p>
            GDB has long been served by a number of debug server options, for Linux class systems
            the gdbserver application provides this functionality, and for embedded systems the
            gdbserver built into OpenOCD is commonly used, but support for some targets (such as RTL
            simulation) we can do better. In this talk, we present a new open source debug server
            that supports these usecases. It is capable of controlling the simplest hardware,
            through to complex multicore heterogenous architectures. I present the aims of this

            In June we announced <a href=""https://embench.org/"" target=""_blank"">Embench</a>™ (for
            Embedded Benchmark), a benchmark for embedded IoT devices created by experts from both
            academia and industry. We first looked at past benchmark efforts to try to incorporate
            their good ideas and to avoid their mistakes, and drew the following seven lessons:
            <ol>
              <li>Embench must be free (no cost).</li>
              <li>Embench must be easy to port and run.</li>
              <li>Embench must be a suite of real programs.  </li>
              <li>Embench must have a supporting organization that maintains its relevance over time.  </li>
              <li>Embench must report a single summarizing performance score.  </li>
              <li>Embench should report geometric mean and standard deviation as the summarizing score. </li>
              <li>Embench must involve both academia and industry.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            Our plan is to follow “Agile Benchmark Development” by bringing out an initial 0.5
            version for evaluation and feedback,  with a 1.0 version to be released after a few
            iterations of preliminary Embench versions (0.5, 0.6, 0.7,...) to debug both the suite
            and the ground rules. We initially aim to evaluate microcontrollers that support ≤64KiB
            of code and read only data—which would typically be stored in Flash or ROM—and ≤16KiB of
            data.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this talk we describe Embench 0.5. Unlike the popular Dhrystone and CoreMark
            benchmarks that are single synthetic programs, Embench 0.5 suite has 20 real
            programs. They do little or no floating point computation, but some are branch
            intensive, some memory intensive, and some integer compute intensive. Like SPEC, the
            single performance number that people will promote is the geometric mean of performance
            relative to a reference platform of the 20 programs plus the geometric standard
            deviation to indicate the significance of differences between processors. Novel features
            of Embench include reporting code size as well as program performance and to measure
            interrupt latency and context switching. These novel features play an important role in
            embedded computing but have not yet appeared in embedded benchmarks. The Free and Open
            Source Silicon (FOSSi) Foundation organization is the official sponsor of Embench. The
            Embench organizing committee now has more than 10 volunteers to evolve the benchmark.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to announcing Embench 0.5, we will demonstrate its value by contrasting its
            performance evaluation of several embedded systems to Dhrystone and CoreMark.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our hope is that henceforth is that publications of performance for embedded computers
            will include Embench along with Dhrystone and CoreMark, and that Embench will eventually
            retire these much older, single, synthetic benchmarks to the dustbin of history.

  For a language as large and complex as SystemVerilog, having a
  tool-independent test suite dedicated to grading against the
  language standard is essential for measuring quality of
  implementation.  Hallmarks of a quality test suite for a
  programming language are: 1) high coverage of syntax and
  semantic concepts in accordance with the standard, 2)
  independence from any particular implementation, 3) universal
  access and availability. Previously, no test suite has existed
  which fits all three criteria. The existence of an open-source
  test suite will benefit the tool development community by
  establishing an objectively measurable common goal.  Publishing
  test results has several benefits: 1) raising community
  awareness about alternative implementations, 2) identifying
  gaps and differences, 3) fueling collaboration among language
  experts and tool developers.  We present our initial effort to
  amass and organize a SystemVerilog test suite whose purpose is
  to qualify tools against the language standard.

It has been used in over 20 tape outs by UC Berkeley alone, and is an important piece of the SiFive FE310 (HiFive 1) embedded SoC as well as the Linux-capable FU540 SoC (HiFive Unleashed). A common question in the open-source community is “How do I integrate Rocket Chip into my SoC”. This talk is an introduction to the use of Rocket Chip and how one might onboard a Verilog IP into a Rocket Chip SoC.

But, for this emerging ecosystem to thrive, we need infrastructure to develop custom hardware accelerators for these platforms and integrate them with web applications and cloud infrastructure. The 1st CLaaS (Custom Logic as a Service) Framework brings cloud FPGAs within reach of the open-source community, startups, and everyone.

1st CLaaS provides an end-to-end solution for streaming data to and from custom logic using WebSockets. It provides infrastructure for development, provisioning, and deployment of custom FPGA logic as a microservice, significantly reducing the development overhead of integrating cloud FPGAs for acceleration of web and cloud applications.

This talk will introduce the framework and some of its recent improvements as well as the impact it could have on open-source silicon.

Over the past year, we have taken the ECP5 support from proof-of-concept to production-ready, and opened up the possibility to use nextpnr to build large and complex designs. This has included augmenting the existing simulated annealing placer with a significantly faster analytical placer (HeAP), adding multi-threaded timing analysis, and adding support for the nitty-gritty hardware details needed for high-speed IO interfaces.

The end result is the capability to build large designs quickly, such as Linux-capable VexRiscv and Rocket processors with DDR3 memory and Gigabit Ethernet. A live demo of this collaborative open gateware and toolchain project will be given.

This talk will introduce some of the improvements made to nextpnr, as well as a roadmap to improved support for even bigger and better FPGAs in the future – and how you can get involved!

Over the years, We have released many open source tools for instrumentation, visualization, and analysis of software and architectures, but RTL design has been a research area quite limited until now. The growth of an Open Digital design ecosystem has enabled BSC to explore computer architecture at a deeper level, closing the gap between academia and industry.

Last May BSC, along Universitat Politècnica de Barcelona (UPC), Centro Nacional de Microelectrònica (CNM) and Centro de Investigación en Computación del Instituto Politécnico Nacional de México (CIC) summited for manufacturing the preDRAC processor, our first RISC-V ASIC design.

Not limited to editing basic entities such as bits and bytes, it provides a full-fledged procedural, interactive programming language designed to describe data structures and to operate on them.

GNU poke is useful in many domains. It is very well suited to aid in the development of programs that operate on binary files, such as assemblers and linkers. It is also good for the fast development of prototypes for programs like linkers, compressors or filters, and it provides a convenient foundation to write other utilities such as diff and patch tools for binary files. I reckon GNU poke could be useful for people working on the software stack for open source hardware systems.

First I will introduce the program and show what it does: from simple bits/bytes editing to user-defined structures and then, very very quickly due to time limitations, will cover how to describe user data, which is to say the art of writing ""pickles"".

Beyond that, the Verilog encryption scheme is basically worthless. See https://acmccs.github.io/papers/p1533-chhotarayA.pdf for futher details. Or if you prefer more practical evidence, spend a little while researching actual attacks on encrypted RTL.

This project is a proof of concept for a utility which would use Verilator to compile a protected Verilog module into a DPI-accessible shared object. While the compiled object could be analyzed, this approach provides little to no opportunity for the plaintext Verilog to be exposed.

Today, two distinct profiles are required to produce an electronic device: hardware designers and software developers. Hardware designers often work on close-source, expensive tool suites with only a small degree of freedom, to produce a suitable hardware prototype. Once low-level software produced (kernel, drivers...) from the hardware specification, software developers then use the prototype as a support for their developments and testing, with other tools. This long, sequential process could be dramatically shortened by using a unique collaborative tool, centered around a software representation of the hardware: a virtual platform.

In this talk, we will present Hiventive's multi-simulator virtual platform engine running a RISC-V virtual platform embedding a Linux distribution. Compare to existing solutions, Hiventive's multi-simulator doesn't focus on only one simulator, but instead take advantage of existing great simulators like QEMU, GEM5, and more.

Since the beginning I had a love/hate relationship with the common RTL languages at best. In the beginning I thought it was just the normal rookie feeling and some persistence would solve it. After almost a decade I am convinced some fundamental shortcomings in the common RTL languages are holding back hardware development productivity and the usability by non-experts like makers.

There is hope though, as I will also highlight some recent developments which in my opinion are a big step in the right direction.
