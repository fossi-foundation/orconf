<h3><a name="presentations" class="anchor" href="#presentations"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Presentations and bios</h3>

<h4><a name="openriscupdate" class="anchor" href="#openriscupdate"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>OpenRISC Project Update</h4>

<p>The OpenRISC project's annual status report.</p>

<h4><a name="mor1kx" class="anchor" href="#mor1kx"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><i>mor1kx</i> progress report</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx">mor1kx core</a> goes from strength to strength, and since we last met, the core's seen a suite of new features improving performance and extending functionality, prominent amongst which is multicore support.</p>

<h4><a name="stekern" class="anchor" href="#stekern"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Stefan Kristiansson</h4>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/skristiansson">Stefan Kristiansson</a> works as an embedded software developer at Espotel Oy,
and enjoys spending his free time with everything related to open source CPU design.
During his 3.5 years with in the OpenRISC community, he has been involved in practically every area of the project, from developing CPU RTL, such as the the mor1kx OpenRISC implementation, to tool chain ports (LLVM, GCC, binutils) and Linux kernel development.
</p>

<h4><a name="riscv" class="anchor" href="#riscv"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>RISC-V: A Free and Open Instruction Set Architecture</h4>

<p><a href="http://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> is a new instruction set architecture (ISA) that was originally
designed to support computer architecture research and education, but
for which we now have grander goals: Just as Linux has become the
standard OS for most computing devices, we envision RISC-V becoming
the standard ISA for all computing devices.</p>

<p>In this talk, I'll first present our arguments why instruction sets
want to be free, then introduce our motivations in designing a new
ISA, give an overview of the RISC-V ISA, and conclude with current
status and future plans.</p>

<h4><a name="krste" class="anchor" href="#krste"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Krste Asanovic</h4>

<p><a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~krste/">Krste Asanovic</a> is a Professor in the EECS Department at the University
of California, Berkeley.  He received a B.A. in Electrical and
Information Sciences from Cambridge University in 1987 and a Ph.D. in
Computer Science from U.C. Berkeley in 1998.  He joined the EECS

<h4><a name="lowrisc" class="anchor" href="#lowrisc"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>lowRISC</h4>

<p>The <a href="http://lowrisc.org">lowRISC</a> project has been formed to produce a System-on-Chip which
will be open source right down to the HDL, implementing the open
RISC-V instruction set architecture. We plan volume silicon
manufacture and will be creating and distributing low-cost development
boards. This talk will describe the aims of the lowRISC project,
summarise its current status, describe some of the features we are
implementing, and give details on how you can get involved.</p>

<h4><a name="alex" class="anchor" href="#alex"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Alex Bradbury</h4>

<p><a href="http://asbradbury.org/research/">Alex Bradbury</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/asbradbury">@asbradbury</a>) is a co-founder of the lowRISC project. He
is a researcher at the University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory
where he works on compilation techniques for a novel many-core
architecture. Additionally, he writes LLVM Weekly (<a href="https://twitter.com/llvmweekly">@llvmweekly</a>), is
co-author of Learning Python with Raspberry Pi, and has been a
contributor to the Raspberry Pi project since the first alpha hardware
was available.</p>

<h4><a name="sdb" class="anchor" href="#sdb"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>SDB: Self Describing Bus </h4>
<p>SDB is a data structure, to be stored on ROM-alike memory, that
   describes an address space made of cores.  Each core has a vendor ID,
   a device ID, name and other attributes. We require 64 bytes of storage
   to describe each code, within a 64-bit address space, plus one extra
   64 bytes for each interconnect.  Informational structures are
   available to easy design-wide identification, including web links and
   commit identifiers.</p>

<p>   We also use SDB for information storage in small EEPROM devices. This
   is a great step forward over using hardwired addresses, as we can now
   make sense of eeprom images in various environment.  The same library
   functions we use to enumerate cores (either in the soft-cpu within the
   fpga itself or in the host operating system) can also be used to
   access stored configuration data, so the code overhead is very
   limited.  Like an address space, an SDB storage device has a read-only
   structure but can include read-write files; to this aim SDB aligns all
   writable files to the erase blocks of the host flash/eeprom device.</p>

<p>   The presentation will show the design ideas behind SDB, our use for
   FPGA address spaces and storage, and the software support we provide
   to users of SDB.</p>

<h4><a name="licensing" class="anchor" href="#licensing"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Open Source Licensing </h4>
<p>A status report on the state of open source licensing for hardware and digital designs. Alessandro works with CERN who publish the <a href="http://www.ohwr.org/projects/cernohl/wiki">CERN OHL</a>, and who are actively promoting the development and use of open source hardware in general. More recently, discussions have gone to licensing of HDL designs(<a href="http://www.ohwr.org/documents/341">1</a>, <a href="http://jolt.law.harvard.edu/articles/pdf/v25/25HarvJLTech131.pdf">2</a>), a topic which is fraught with uncertainties about exactly what rights may be afforded the author in the event of it being used in a simulation, an FPGA bistream, or a manufactured ASIC.</p>


<h4><a name="alessandro" class="anchor" href="#alessandro"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Alessandro Rubini</h4>
<p>   Alessandro is working on SDB as consultant for the hardware and timing
   section of the CERN controls group.  SDB is designed jointly by CERN
   and GSI within the White Rabbit project.  The specification, HDL macros,

<h4><a name="migen" class="anchor" href="#migen"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>migen and miSoC</h4>
<p>
<a href="https://github.com/m-labs/migen">Migen</a> is a powerful open source Python framework for writing digital designs (ASIC/FPGA): it allows the design logic to be generated by a Python program which enables hardware designers to take advantage of the richness of the Python language - object oriented programming, function parameters, generators, operator overloading, libraries, etc. - to build well organized, reusable and elegant designs.
</p>
<p>
MiSoC is a complete open source System-on-Chip designed entirely with Migen. It works across many different boards and FPGA vendors, letting you chose LatticeMico32 or mor1kx as CPU with a simple command line switch.
</p>
<p>
This presentation will show what Migen looks like, what it can do and how to very easily start using it, in the form of a terminal based demo.
</p>

<h4><a name="yann" class="anchor" href="#yann"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Yann Sionneau</h4>
<p>
<a href="http://twitter.com/yannsionneau">Yann Sionneau</a> is a 26 year old Embedded software engineer working at M-Labs on open source software and FPGA design using Migen technology. Since he touched his first computer he has always been driven by his curiosity to try and understand the underlying technology, digging deeper and deeper in the computer architecture layers. This curiosity then turned into the passion of learning from and playing with (deeply) embedded architectures, down to how System-on-Chips and CPUs actually work.
</p>
<p>
Within the M-Labs (formerly known as Milkymist) community, he wrote the basic parts of the Board Support Package (of RTEMS) running on the Milkymist One digital video synthesizer. He then participated (with Michael Walle) in the design of an MMU for the LatticeMico32 CPU and then ported the NetBSD 6 kernel to run on the Milkymist SoC.
