                    This year we're offering lightning talk and 15-minute speaking slots, with the
                    choice of opting in to be considered for an extended slot of 30-40 minutes. We
                    are intentionally reducing the standard speaking slot length this year to ensure
                    we can accomodate all of the exceptional talk submissions we recieve, and to
                    maximise face-to-face time throughout the event. We encourage speakers to skip
                    the technical deep-dive presentations and instead provide high-level
                    introductions and overviews of what makes their work great, and prepare a poster
                    or hardware demo for people to come and discuss details during the breaks.

	  <h4><a name="riscv" href="#riscv"></a>The Momentum and Opportunity of Custom, Open Source Processing</h4>
           <p>

             The growth of human and business interaction with
             technology continues to explode. At the literal heart of
             that technology sits a silicon core, combined with
             general and specific instructions and connections. The
             insane cost, risk, development time, necessary volumes,
             and limited computing demands kept the lucrative chip
             opportunity within reach of just a handful of companies
             -- focused mostly on general purpose processors. New
             computing needs in various power and performance
             dimensions have increased demand and competition for
             custom processors. This pressure is quietly and rapidly
             disrupting the processor industry. An Open source
             approach to processors now reduces risk and investment,
             with accelerated time to market, and opens the
             opportunity to thousands of possible custom
             processors. Learn about the trends, opportunities, and
             examples -- from smart watches to supercomputers -- as
             well as the global momentum of RISC-V!

                with both iCE40 and highly experimental ECP5 support. Over the past year, we have taken the
                ECP5 support from proof-of-concept to production-ready, and opened up the possibility to use nextpnr
                to build large and complex designs. This has included augmenting the existing simulated annealing
                placer with a significantly faster analytical placer (HeAP), adding multi-threaded timing analysis,
                and adding support for the nitty-gritty hardware details needed for high-speed IO interfaces.
              </p>
              <p>

              <p>
                Open source penetrates the microelectronics design, making hardware development more accessible.
                To leverage this effect, one needs open CAD tools, including formal verification facilities.
                The talk is concentrated on an experimental comparison of several open-source model checkers
                for Verilog modules on open benchmarks. For selected tools Verilog support and property checking
                facilities were evaluated on typical designs and industrial-scale modules. This talk also
                briefly describes <a href="https://forge.ispras.ru/projects/retrascope"
                                     target="_blank">Retrascope</a>
                - a new open-source model checker that verifies Verilog descriptions
                against SVA properties. The toolkit allows analyzing of HDL descriptions,
                reconstructing and visualization of the underlying models and using the derived models
                for test generation and property checking.

                <a href="https://github.com/bobbl/rudolv/" target="_blank">RudolV</a> is yet another

                components like out-of-order execution, dynamic branch prediction or caches.
                Without affecting the predictability, techniques like instruction fusion,
                in-order dual issue and decoupled fetching can improve its throughput.

            <a name="netlistpaths" href="#netlistpaths"></a>netlist-paths: A command line tool for querying paths in a Verilog design</h4>
              <p>
                In a complex Verilog design, it can be difficult to relate timing reports for
                critical paths back to the the source code because of the way a design is flattened
                and optimised in a physical design flow. Being able to quickly correspond a timing
                path to the source code is useful in determining causes and potential fixes. This
                talk describes <a href="https://github.com/jameshanlon/netlist-paths"
                target="_blank">a simple command-line tool</a> to do this. It uses a modified
                version of
                Verilator to obtain a netlist from Verilog source code and provides options to query
                paths and cones of logic by specifying start, end and through points in the design,
                similar to what you find with EDA tooling.

            <a name="poke" href="#poke"></a>GNU poke, an extensible editor for structured binary data</h4>
              <p>
                GNU poke is a new interactive editor for binary data.  Not limited to editing basic
                entities such as bits and bytes, it provides a full-fledged procedural, interactive
                programming language designed to describe data structures and to operate on them.
              </p>
              <p>
                GNU poke is useful in many domains.  It is very well suited to aid in the
                development of programs that operate on binary files, such as assemblers and
                linkers. It is also good for the fast development of prototypes for programs like
              linkers,
                compressors or filters, and it provides a convenient foundation to write other
                utilities such as diff and patch tools for binary files.  I reckon GNU poke could be
                useful for people working on the software stack for open source hardware systems.
              </p>
              <p>
                First I will introduce the program and show what it does: from simple bits/bytes
                editing to user-defined structures and then, very very quickly due to time
                limitations,  will cover how to describe user data, which is to say the art of
                writing "pickles".

              <p>
                With a software background I stumbled in the hardware 'programming' languages beginning of this decade.
                Since the beginning I had a love/hate relationship with the common RTL languages at best. In the
                beginning I thought it was just the normal rookie feeling and some persistence would
                solve it. After almost a decade I am convinced some fundamental shortcomings in the
                common RTL languages are holding back hardware development productivity and the
                usability by non-experts like makers.
              </p>
              <p>
                There is hope though, as I will also highlight some recent developments which in my

            <a name="asicone" href="#asicone"></a>ASICone, from Verilog to GDSII with open source tools only, Status and Challenges</h4>
            <p>
              Last year, Symbiotic EDA announced ASICone, an experiment to tape-out an entire ASIC
              with a RISC-V 32bit processor, using only open source tools on X-Fab 180nm COMS
              3.3V. As expected, ASICone had been a very difficult project. The team around
              Prof. Elkim Roa (OnChip) believes that they have found some of the most important gaps
              between a typical tape-out (with commercial EDA tools) and a tape-out with open-source
              tools. Taking this into account, in this talk, team member Luis Rueda will present the
              status of ASICone: what have been done and achieved so far, what have been the
              learning's, what is needed to close the feature gaps in the current available open
              source ASIC toolchain and what should be the next steps.

          <a name="embench" href="#embench"></a>Embench™ 0.5: A Free Benchmark Suite for  IoT from an Academic-Industry Cooperative</h4>
          <p>
            In June we announced <a href="https://embench.org/" target="_blank">Embench</a>™ (for
            Embedded Benchmark), a benchmark for embedded IoT devices created by experts from both
            academia and industry. We first looked at past benchmark efforts to try to incorporate
            their good ideas and to avoid their mistakes, and drew the following seven lessons:
            <ol>
              <li>Embench must be free (no cost).</li>
              <li>Embench must be easy to port and run.</li>
              <li>Embench must be a suite of real programs.  </li>
              <li>Embench must have a supporting organization that maintains its relevance over time.  </li>
              <li>Embench must report a single summarizing performance score.  </li>
              <li>Embench should report geometric mean and standard deviation as the summarizing score. </li>
              <li>Embench must involve both academia and industry.</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            Our plan is to follow “Agile Benchmark Development” by bringing out an initial 0.5
            version for evaluation and feedback,  with a 1.0 version to be released after a few
            iterations of preliminary Embench versions (0.5, 0.6, 0.7,...) to debug both the suite
            and the ground rules. We initially aim to evaluate microcontrollers that support ≤64KiB
            of code and read only data—which would typically be stored in Flash or ROM—and ≤16KiB of
            data.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this talk we describe Embench 0.5. Unlike the popular Dhrystone and CoreMark
            benchmarks that are single synthetic programs, Embench 0.5 suite has 20 real
            programs. They do little or no floating point computation, but some are branch
            intensive, some memory intensive, and some integer compute intensive. Like SPEC, the
            single performance number that people will promote is the geometric mean of performance
            relative to a reference platform of the 20 programs plus the geometric standard
            deviation to indicate the significance of differences between processors. Novel features
            of Embench include reporting code size as well as program performance and to measure
            interrupt latency and context switching. These novel features play an important role in
            embedded computing but have not yet appeared in embedded benchmarks. The Free and Open
            Source Silicon (FOSSi) Foundation organization is the official sponsor of Embench. The
            Embench organizing committee now has more than 10 volunteers to evolve the benchmark.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to announcing Embench 0.5, we will demonstrate its value by contrasting its
            performance evaluation of several embedded systems to Dhrystone and CoreMark.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our hope is that henceforth is that publications of performance for embedded computers
            will include Embench along with Dhrystone and CoreMark, and that Embench will eventually
            retire these much older, single, synthetic benchmarks to the dustbin of history.

              <p>
                The rise of open hardware pushed by open architectures such as RISC-V must be
                accompanied by open tool suites making it accessible to the largest number. Today,
                two distinct profiles are required to produce an electronic device: hardware
                designers and software developers. Hardware designers often work on close-source,
                expensive tool suites with only a small degree of freedom, to produce a suitable
                hardware prototype. Once low-level software produced (kernel, drivers...) from the
                hardware specification, software developers then use the prototype as a support for
                their developments and testing, with other tools. This long, sequential process
                could be dramatically shortened by using a unique collaborative tool, centered
                around a software representation of the hardware: a virtual platform.
              </p>

              <p>
                A Globally Asynchronous, Locally Synchronous (GALS) circuit consists of a set of
                locally synchronous modules with isolated clock domains communicating with each
                other via asynchronous wrappers. Because of the reduced EM interference and lower
                power requirements, the GALS approach is one of the most promising techniques for
                building the next generation of System-on-Chip (SoC) devices, being specially fitted
                for Network-on-Chip (NoC) based architectures.
              </p>
              <p>
                Obscurity and lack of proper fine-grained control in proprietary toolchains has
                historically supposed a very limiting factor for any asynchronous logic design
                research effort related with FPGAs. In this talk, we will demonstrate with a

            <a name="debug" href="#debug"></a>A Unified Debug Server for Deeply Embedded Systems and GDB/LLDB</h4>
          <p>
            When debugging C applications, whilst the debugger handles high level operations, it
            abstracts and offloads lower level operations to a debug server which is responsible for
            controlling the process or hardware. The debug server is capable of very simple
            operations, such as reading/writing registers and memory, starting and single-stepping
            the processor and reporting back when the processor halts. The two communicate with each
            other using a very simple text based serial protocol.
          </p>
          <p>
            GDB has long been served by a number of debug server options, for Linux class systems
            the gdbserver application provides this functionality, and for embedded systems the
            gdbserver built into OpenOCD is commonly used, but support for some targets (such as RTL
            simulation) we can do better. In this talk, we present a new open source debug server
            that supports these usecases. It is capable of controlling the simplest hardware,
            through to complex multicore heterogenous architectures. I present the aims of this
            project and what we want to achieve as this progresses.

            <a name="vprv2x" href="#vprv2x"></a>Versatile Place and Route (VPR) device models generation from Verilog with V2X</h4>
          <p>
            <a href="https://docs.verilogtorouting.org/en/latest/arch/" target="_blank">VPR</a>, an
            open source Place&amp;Route tool developed primarily by the University of Toronto,
            describes the FPGA devices architecture using model and pb_type XML files
            . The XML files can be really complex depending on the device architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            V2X is an open source tool for generating FPGA architecture description XML files from
            Verilog models. The models can be reused as device simulation modes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently V2X supports the following features:
            <ul>
              <li>Black box models and architecture description definition</li>
              <li>Complex block aggregation other complex blocks and/or black boxes</li>
              <li>Routing components</li>
              <li>FASM (FPGA Assembly) annotations</li>
            </ul>
